          <h2>Welcome to Days for Girls Solon Team</h2>
          <p>
            We are one of hundreds of volunteer Days for Girls teams around the
            world working to advance menstrual equity and health education. Our
            team donates time and talent to sew and assemble high-quality,
            reusable menstrual kits that provide sustainable solutions for
            managing periods with dignity.
          </p>
          <p>
            What makes our team unique is our special partnership with a
            community in Puerto Barrios, Guatemala. Together, we go beyond the
            kits — building relationships, sharing menstrual health education,
            and empowering both women and men to understand and support
            menstrual health.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through our ongoing connection with Puerto Barrios, we see the real
            impact of our work: girls who can stay in school, women who can
            participate fully in daily life, and communities that grow stronger
            through knowledge and compassion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our mission is simple but powerful — to create access, education,
            and dignity — one kit, one community, and one conversation at a
            time.

            you're an experienced sewer or just want to lend a hand!
