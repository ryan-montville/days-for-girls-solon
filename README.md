# days-for-girls-solon

This app was created for Comp 424 - Client-side Design & Development.

This app was created for the Days for Girls Solon team to convert their current Google forms and spreadsheets into a web app to track inventory, manage/display upcoming events, and a way for new members to join the mailing list.
